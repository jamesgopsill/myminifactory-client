# MyMiniFactory Typescript API client

The client has been developed as part of a research programme investigating agent-based manufacturing systems ([Brokering Additive Manufacturing](https://dmf-lab.co.uk/brokering-additive-manufacturing/)). It is isomorphic capable of running on server (Node.js) and client-side (Browser) applications.

**Current Under Construction and Untested**

## Client Docs
